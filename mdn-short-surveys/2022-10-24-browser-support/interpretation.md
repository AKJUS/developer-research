# Interpretation
## Analysis
* More than ⅔ of developers consider a feature stable as soon as it has been in major browsers for two major versions. 20% require support going back further.
* Seems to indicate that defining a Web Platform baseline that most developers target most of the time is possible. 
* We don’t have per browser information on needed support. Asking those questions might lead to different results.
* Market share is not necessarily the best indicator for which browsers need to be considered part of the “major browsers set”

## Future improvements
We originally wanted to ask about needed support versions for each browser individually, but were limited by the format of the short surveys. It would have looked too intimidating as a wall of options,  and would have likely lead to lower participation in the survey overall. A follow up should clarify developer sentiments on a per browser basis.
