# Principles for joint developer research

This document aims for agreement on general principles and approaches regarding research.

## Principles

- Research results should always be published publicly, unless there is a strong reason for not to
- Research needs to be focused enough to get useful and actionable data
- Balanced number of stakeholders to avoid too much 'design by committee'
- Create short and clear surveys, to respect developers’ survey fatigue and lack of time
- Do research often enough, so it’s not just an annual check-in
- Ensure it’s not too time consuming for stakeholders to create and analyze

## Benefits

- Much quicker to take for developers, therefore causing less survey fatigue
- Good to get a quick indication on certain topics
- Quick turnaround time for stakeholders on getting results
- Can be run with a good cadence, e.g. monthly
- Present the result publicly so everyone has the same view and information
