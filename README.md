# Web Developer experience research workstream

This repository hosts the research workstream of the [W3C WebDX Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/webdx/), which focuses on coordinating _quantitative_ and _qualitative_ research efforts to better understand the major obstacles and gaps that developers face when using the Web.

See [issues](https://github.com/web-platform-dx/developer-research/issues) for discussions and explorations of possible surveys.

The repository contains [results of past surveys](https://github.com/web-platform-dx/developer-research/tree/main/mdn-short-surveys), along with an interpretation of the results.
